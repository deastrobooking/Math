Perfect. Let’s dive deep into **Calculus I (Differential Calculus)**—not just formulas, but the "why" and "how" behind the core ideas. We’ll break it into essential topics, building from limits to the applications of derivatives.

---

## 🧭 **1. Limits and Continuity**

### 🔹 What is a Limit?
A **limit** describes the behavior of a function as the input gets close to a value—even if the function isn’t defined there.

**Example:**
\[
\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 - 1) = 3
\]
Because as \( x \) gets closer to 2, \( x^2 - 1 \) gets closer to 3.

### 🔹 Formal Definition (Epsilon-Delta):
We say:
\[
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
\]
if, for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that:
\[
0 < |x - a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
\]

### 🔹 Types of Limits:
- **One-sided limits:** \( \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x), \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) \)
- **Infinite limits:** Function grows without bound near a point
- **Limits at infinity:** Behavior as \( x \to \infty \)

### 🔹 Continuity:
A function \( f \) is **continuous at \( x = a \)** if:
\[
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)
\]

---

## ⚡ **2. The Derivative: Rate of Change**

### 🔹 The Core Idea
The derivative measures how fast a function is changing at any point—its **instantaneous rate of change** or the **slope of the tangent line**.

### 🔹 Formal Definition:
\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\]

This is the foundation of all differential calculus.

\]

### Product Rule:

\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
\]

### Quotient Rule:

\]

### Chain Rule:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
\]

---

## 🧪 **4. Derivatives of Special Functions**

- \( \frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) = -\sin x \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) = \sec^2 x \)

### Exponential & Logs:

---

## 📈 **5. Applications of Derivatives**

### 🔹 Finding Tangent Lines:
The derivative gives you the slope:
\[
y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
\]

### 🔹 Increasing/Decreasing Behavior:
- \( f'(x) > 0 \Rightarrow f \) is increasing
- \( f'(x) < 0 \Rightarrow f \) is decreasing

### 🔹 Critical Points:
Points where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or undefined.

### 🔹 First Derivative Test:
Used to find **local maxima and minima**.

### 🔹 Second Derivative Test:
- \( f''(x) > 0 \Rightarrow \) local **min**
- \( f''(x) < 0 \Rightarrow \) local **max**

### 🔹 Concavity:
- \( f''(x) > 0 \Rightarrow \) concave **up**
- \( f''(x) < 0 \Rightarrow \) concave **down**

### 🔹 Inflection Points:
Where \( f''(x) = 0 \) and concavity changes

---

## 📏 **6. Optimization Problems**

**Process:**
1. Write an equation for the quantity to optimize
2. Write constraints
3. Substitute to get one variable
4. Take derivative and solve \( f'(x) = 0 \)
5. Use second derivative test or endpoints

---

## 🌀 **7. Related Rates**

A powerful application of implicit differentiation when variables are changing with time.

### Example:
If \( A = \pi r^2 \), and \( \frac{dr}{dt} \) is known, find \( \frac{dA}{dt} \).

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = 2\pi r \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}
\]

\]

---

Awesome—let’s use a **real-world EE example** involving **voltage and current in an RC circuit**, then walk through it step-by-step using derivatives.

---

## 🔌 **Problem: Capacitor Charging in an RC Circuit**

In a simple RC circuit (Resistor + Capacitor in series), the voltage across the capacitor as it charges is:

\[
V_C(t) = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-t/RC} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( V_0 \) = supply voltage (constant)
- \( R \) = resistance in ohms (Ω)
- \( C \) = capacitance in farads (F)
- \( t \) = time in seconds
- \( V_C(t) \) = voltage across the capacitor

---

### 🎯 **Goal: Find the rate of change of the capacitor voltage with respect to time**  
That is:  
\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt}
\]

---

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Derivative Solution**

We’ll treat \( V_0, R, \) and \( C \) as constants.

### Step 1: Start with the given function
\[
V_C(t) = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-t/RC} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Differentiate both sides with respect to \( t \)
\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ V_0 \left(1 - e^{-t/RC} \right) \right]
\]

Since \( V_0 \) is a constant, and derivative of 1 is 0:

\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = V_0 \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left(- e^{-t/RC} \right)
\]

### Step 3: Use the chain rule on the exponential
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-t/RC}) = e^{-t/RC} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{RC}\right)
\]

So:

\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = V_0 \cdot \left(- \left( -\frac{1}{RC} \cdot e^{-t/RC} \right)\right)
\]

\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = \frac{V_0}{RC} \cdot e^{-t/RC}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{ \frac{dV_C}{dt} = \frac{V_0}{RC} \cdot e^{-t/RC} }
\]

---

## 🔍 Interpretation:
- The rate at which the capacitor charges **decreases over time**, since \( e^{-t/RC} \) decays.
- Initially, at \( t = 0 \):
  \[
  \frac{dV_C}{dt} = \frac{V_0}{RC}
  \]
  → the fastest charging rate.
- As \( t \to \infty \), \( \frac{dV_C}{dt} \to 0 \), i.e. capacitor approaches full charge.

# RC Discharging Circuit: Voltage And Its Rate Of Change
![output (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/175265d9-3f6b-45c8-8f9b-4f14a5d5e448)

Here’s the visualization of a **discharging RC circuit**:

---

### 🔋 **Blue Curve: Voltage \( V_C(t) \)**
\[
V_C(t) = V_0 e^{-t/RC}
\]
- Starts at \( V_0 = 5 \) volts and **exponentially decays** over time.
- This shows how the capacitor gradually loses its stored charge.

---

### 📉 **Red Dashed Curve: Derivative \( \frac{dV_C}{dt} \)**
\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = -\frac{V_0}{RC} e^{-t/RC}
\]
- This is the **rate at which the voltage is dropping**.
- Initially, it's most negative (fastest discharge), and then it levels out toward zero.
- Negative sign indicates **voltage is decreasing**.

---

### 🔍 EE Insight:
- The **time constant** \( \tau = RC \) controls how fast the voltage drops.
- After **one time constant**, \( V_C \approx 36.8\% \) of \( V_0 \).
- By about \( 5\tau \), the capacitor is nearly fully discharged.

---

Would you like to:
- Explore **current** behavior during charging/discharging?
- Derive a general expression for **energy stored** in the capacitor?
- Dive into **step-by-step derivation of Kirchhoff's laws** using calculus?

You lead the charge! ⚡

Perfect choice! Let’s **dive deep** into **Kirchhoff’s Laws** using Calculus I, II, and III, and build a complete understanding from fundamentals to multivariable analysis, using an RC circuit as our base system.

---

## 🧩 **Overview of Kirchhoff’s Laws**

### 1. **Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)**  
The **sum of currents into a node is zero** (conservation of charge):
\[
\sum I_{\text{in}} = \sum I_{\text{out}}
\]

### 2. **Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)**  
The **sum of voltages in a closed loop is zero** (conservation of energy):
\[
\sum V = 0
\]

We’ll focus mainly on **KVL** for applying Calculus in a looped RC circuit.

---

## 🔁 **Example Circuit: Series RC Discharge**

We’ll apply **KVL** around the loop:

### 🪫 Resistor + Capacitor in series:
\[
V_R(t) + V_C(t) = 0
\]

Where:
- \( V_R(t) = i(t)R \)
- \( V_C(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int i(t)\, dt \)

---

## 🧠 **Calculus I (Derivatives): Express in Terms of Current**

Let’s differentiate both sides of:
\[
i(t)R + \frac{1}{C} \int i(t)\,dt = 0
\]

Differentiate both sides with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( i(t)R + \frac{1}{C} \int i(t)\,dt \right) = 0
\]

\[
R \frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} i(t) = 0
\]

---

### ✅ **Resulting First-Order Linear Differential Equation:**
\[
\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{RC} i(t) = 0
\]

This is a **Calc I-level derivative model** describing **exponential decay** of current.

---

## 📐 **Calculus II (Solving the Differential Equation with Integrals)**

Now solve:

\[
\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{RC} i(t) = 0
\]

Separate variables:
\[
\frac{1}{i(t)} \, di = -\frac{1}{RC} \, dt
\]

Integrate both sides:
\[
\int \frac{1}{i} \, di = -\int \frac{1}{RC} \, dt
\]

\[
\ln |i(t)| = -\frac{t}{RC} + C_1
\]

Exponentiate both sides:
\[
i(t) = Ce^{-t/RC}
\]

Use initial condition \( i(0) = I_0 \) to find \( C = I_0 \):

\[
\boxed{i(t) = I_0 e^{-t/RC}}
\]

Now we can find:
- \( V_R(t) = RI_0 e^{-t/RC} \)
- \( V_C(t) = V_0 - V_R(t) \) or integrate \( i(t) \) again.

---

## 🌐 **Calculus III (Multivariable + Vector Calculus)**

To stretch into Calc III, imagine a **network of components**, modeled as a **graph** with:

- **Nodes (vertices)** → KCL
- **Edges (branches)** → Voltage drops (KVL)
- **Vector fields** → Currents, voltages as functions in space/time

### 🔹 Vector Field Formulation (Electric Field / EM Fields)

KVL has a deeper analog in vector calculus via **Faraday’s Law**:

\[
\oint_{\partial S} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
\]

Where:
- \( \vec{E} \) is electric field (voltage per unit length)
- \( d\vec{l} \) is a line element around the loop
- \( \Phi_B \) is magnetic flux

In static circuits: \( \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = 0 \), so:
\[
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0 \Rightarrow \) Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

This is a **line integral** of a vector field, which ties directly into **Green’s Theorem** and **Stokes’ Theorem**:

\[
\oint_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \vec{F}) \cdot \hat{n}\, dS
\]

If \( \nabla \times \vec{F} = 0 \), then conservative vector field ⇒ **KVL holds**
