## 🎨 LaTeX Best Practices Applied

### Rules Enforced:
1. **Inline math:** Use `$...$` within sentences and lists
2. **Display math:** Use `$$...$$` for standalone equations
3. **Special characters:** Properly escape `|`, `#`, `{`, `}`
4. **Table compatibility:** Use `\vert` instead of `|` in tables
5. **Consistency:** Uniform notation across all files

---

## 📝 Key Changes Made

### Before:
```markdown
- $$ \frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x $$
If $$ F(x) $$ is an antiderivative...
| $|A|$ | cardinality |
```

### After:
```markdown
- $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x$
If $F(x)$ is an antiderivative...
| $\vert A\vert$ | cardinality |
```
