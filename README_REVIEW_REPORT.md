## LaTeX Improvements

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. **Inline Math Delimiters**
- **Problem:** Used `\( \)` (text-mode LaTeX) instead of markdown-compatible `$...$`
- **Locations:** Throughout the document in sections 2-6 and integration lessons
- **Fix:** Converted all inline math to use `$...$` syntax
- **Example:**
  - Before: `\( f(x) \)` 
  - After: `$f(x)$`

#### 2. **Display Math Formatting**
- **Problem:** Inconsistent spacing in display equations (missing `\,` for differentials)
- **Locations:** Integration rules, definite integrals, Fundamental Theorem
- **Fix:** Added proper spacing with `\,` before `dx`, `du`, `dt`
- **Example:**
  - Before: `\int_a^b f(x)dx`
  - After: `\int_a^b f(x) \, dx`

#### 3. **Limit Notation**
- **Problem:** Used `\lim\limits_{x \to a}` with redundant `\limits`
- **Fix:** Simplified to `\lim_{x \to a}` (which renders correctly in display mode)

#### 4. **Text in Math Mode**
- **Problem:** Conditions like "where a > 0, a â‰  1" not properly formatted
- **Fix:** Used `\text{}` for textual descriptions within equations
- **Example:**
  - Before: `a > 0, a \neq 1`
  - After: `\text{where } a > 0, \, a \neq 1`

#### 5. **Spacing Consistency**
- **Problem:** Inconsistent spacing around operators and functions
- **Fix:** Standardized spacing throughout:
  - Function multiplication: `g(x) \cdot h(x)` instead of `g(x)h(x)`
  - Power notation: `nx^{n-1}` instead of `n x^{n-1}`
  - Operators: Added `\cdot` for explicit multiplication

## Mathematical Logic Audit

### Verified Correct âœ“

#### 1. **Power Rule for Derivatives**
$$\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}$$
- **Status:** âœ… Mathematically correct
- **Verification:** Standard derivative rule

#### 2. **Quotient Rule Example**
$$\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{x^2}{x+1} \right) = \frac{x^2 + 2x}{(x+1)^2}$$
- **Status:** âœ… Verified with symbolic computation
- **Calculation:** 
  - Numerator: $2x(x+1) - x^2(1) = 2x^2 + 2x - x^2 = x^2 + 2x$
  - Denominator: $(x+1)^2$

#### 3. **Integration by Parts Example**
$$\int x e^x \, dx = xe^x - e^x + C$$
- **Status:** âœ… Verified with symbolic computation
- **Alternative form:** $(x-1)e^x + C$ (algebraically equivalent)

#### 4. **Definite Integral Example**
$$\int_1^3 x^2 \, dx = \frac{26}{3}$$
- **Status:** âœ… Verified numerically
- **Calculation:** $\left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_1^3 = \frac{27}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{26}{3} \approx 8.67$

#### 5. **Chain Rule**
$$\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$$
- **Status:** âœ… Corrected notation for consistency
- **Change:** Added explicit multiplication operator and `\frac{d}{dx}` notation

#### 6. **Integration Power Rule**
$$\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \quad \text{(for } n \neq -1\text{)}$$
- **Status:** âœ… Correct with proper restriction
- **Note:** The $n \neq -1$ condition is essential (that case gives $\ln|x|$)

## Content Improvements

### 1. **Clarified Limit Definition**
- **Original:** "If the function approaches a specific value, the limit exists."
- **Improved:** "If the function approaches a specific value from both sides and these one-sided limits agree, the limit exists."
- **Reason:** More mathematically precise, acknowledges one-sided vs. two-sided limits

### 2. **Formatting Consistency**
- Standardized all inline math references
- Consistent spacing in display equations
- Uniform notation throughout (e.g., always using $\cdot$ for multiplication when needed)

### 3. **Professional Closure**
- Removed conversational ending ("Would you like me to include problem sets for practice? ðŸš€")
- Added professional review timestamp
- Maintained informative and academic tone
