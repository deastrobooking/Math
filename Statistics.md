### **Mathematical Terminology and Syntax in Statistics**

Understanding statistics requires familiarity with fundamental mathematical terminology and notation. Below is a breakdown of key concepts and their syntax.

---

## **1. Basic Statistical Symbols and Notation**
| **Symbol** | **Meaning** |
|-----------|------------|
| \( x \) | Individual data point |
| \( X \) | Set of all observations (dataset) |
| \( \bar{x} \) | Mean (average) of a sample |
| \( \mu \) | Population mean |
| \( \sigma \) | Population standard deviation |
| \( s \) | Sample standard deviation |
| \( N \) | Total population size |
| \( n \) | Sample size |
| \( \Sigma \) | Summation symbol (sum of all values) |
| \( P(A) \) | Probability of event \( A \) |
| \( p \) | Population proportion |
| \( \hat{p} \) | Sample proportion |

---

## **2. Descriptive Statistics Notation**
### **Mean (Average)**
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
\]
- \( \bar{x} \) = Sample Mean
- \( x_i \) = Individual data values
- \( n \) = Number of values in the sample

For a population mean:
\[
\mu = \frac{\sum X}{N}
\]
where \( N \) is the total number of data points in the population.

---

### **Median**
The middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order. If \( n \) is even, the median is:
\[
\frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2} + 1}}{2}
\]

---

### **Mode**
The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

---

### **Variance and Standard Deviation**
#### **Sample Variance (\( s^2 \))**
\[
s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
\]
- Measures how spread out the data points are.

#### **Sample Standard Deviation (\( s \))**
\[
s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
\]
- Measures dispersion in the sample.

#### **Population Variance (\( \sigma^2 \))**
\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \mu)^2}{N}
\]

#### **Population Standard Deviation (\( \sigma \))**
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
\]

---

## **3. Probability Terminology and Notation**
| **Symbol** | **Meaning** |
|-----------|------------|
| \( P(A) \) | Probability of event \( A \) occurring |
| \( P(A \cap B) \) | Probability of both \( A \) and \( B \) occurring (Intersection) |
| \( P(A \cup B) \) | Probability of either \( A \) or \( B \) occurring (Union) |
| \( P(A | B) \) | Conditional probability (Probability of \( A \) given \( B \)) |
| \( 1 - P(A) \) | Complement Rule (Probability of \( A \) *not* occurring) |
| \( P(A) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}} \) | Probability Formula |

#### **Bayesâ€™ Theorem**
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
- Used to find conditional probabilities.

#### **Binomial Probability Formula**
\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]
where:
- \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) (Combination formula)
- \( p \) is the probability of success
- \( k \) is the number of successes
- \( n \) is the total trials

---

## **4. Inferential Statistics Terminology**
### **Z-Score**
A measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
\[
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]
For a sample:
\[
Z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}
\]

### **Confidence Interval (CI)**
\[
\bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]
- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value from the Z-table.
- Used to estimate a range in which the true population parameter lies.

### **Hypothesis Testing**
- **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))**: Assumes no effect or difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_A \))**: Assumes an effect or difference exists.
- **P-Value**: Probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed data under \( H_0 \).
  - If \( P < 0.05 \), reject \( H_0 \) (statistically significant).

### **T-Test Formula**
\[
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
\]
- Used to compare two means.

---

## **5. Regression Analysis Terminology**
### **Linear Regression Equation**
\[
y = mx + b
\]
or
\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
\]
where:
- \( y \) = Dependent variable (response)
- \( x \) = Independent variable (predictor)
- \( \beta_0 \) = Intercept
- \( \beta_1 \) = Slope
- \( \epsilon \) = Error term

### **Correlation Coefficient (\( r \))**
\[
r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\]
- Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship.

---

## **6. Data Distribution Terminology**
- **Normal Distribution**: Symmetric, bell-shaped distribution.
  - Mean \( \mu \) and Standard Deviation \( \sigma \).
  - 68-95-99.7 Rule: 68% of data within 1\( \sigma \), 95% within 2\( \sigma \), 99.7% within 3\( \sigma \).

- **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry.
  - Right-skewed (positive skew) â†’ Tail on the right.
  - Left-skewed (negative skew) â†’ Tail on the left.

- **Kurtosis**: Measures the "tailedness" of a distribution.
  - High kurtosis â†’ More extreme outliers.
  - Low kurtosis â†’ Fewer extreme outliers.

---

## **7. Common Statistical Functions in Programming**
Most statistical calculations can be performed using programming languages like Python or R.

### **Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas)**
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Mean and Standard Deviation
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mean = np.mean(data)
std_dev = np.std(data, ddof=1)

# Z-score
z_scores = stats.zscore(data)

# Hypothesis Testing (T-test)
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(data, popmean=25)

print(mean, std_dev, t_stat, p_value)
```

### **R**
```r
data <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Mean and Standard Deviation
mean(data)
sd(data)

# Z-score
scale(data)

# T-test
t.test(data, mu=25)
```
