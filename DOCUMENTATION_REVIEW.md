## Issues Found and Fixed 🔧

### 1. **symbolsguide.md** - Critical LaTeX Rendering Errors

#### Issues:
- **Pipe symbols in tables** breaking column structure
- **Dirac notation** incomplete due to pipe conflicts
- **Hash symbol** (`#`) not escaped in LaTeX
- **Anticommutator braces** not properly escaped

#### Fixes Applied:
✅ Changed `$|A|$` → `$\vert A\vert$` (cardinality)  
✅ Changed `$|z|$` → `$\vert z\vert$` (complex modulus)  
✅ Changed `$|x|$` → `$\vert x\vert$` (absolute value)  
✅ Fixed Dirac notation:
   - `$\vert\psi\rangle$` (ket)
   - `$\langle\psi\vert$` (bra)
   - `$\langle\phi\vert\psi\rangle$` (inner product)
   - `$\vert\psi\rangle\langle\psi\vert$` (projector)
   - `$\langle\psi\vert\hat A\vert\psi\rangle$` (expectation value)  
✅ Changed `$#A$` → `$\#A$` (cardinality notation)  
✅ Changed `${...}$` → `$\{...\}$` (anticommutator)

**Why these failed:** In Markdown tables, `|` is interpreted as column delimiter. In LaTeX, `#` is a macro parameter symbol and `{}` are grouping operators - all need escaping.

### 2. **calc_1.md** - Inline vs Display Math Issues

#### Issues:
- Mixed use of `$$` (display math) in inline contexts
- Math expressions mid-sentence using `$$` breaking flow
- List items with `$$` causing rendering problems

#### Fixes Applied:
✅ Increasing/Decreasing: `$$ f'(x) > 0 \Rightarrow f $$` → `$f'(x) > 0 \Rightarrow f$`  
✅ Second Derivative Test: Changed to inline `$`  
✅ Concavity: Changed to inline `$`  
✅ Trigonometric derivatives: Changed from `$$` to `$` in list  
✅ Exponential & Log derivatives: Changed from `$$` to `$` in list  
✅ Various inline variable references throughout

**Rule:** Use `$...$` for inline math (within sentences/lists), `$$...$$` for standalone display equations.

---

### 3. **README.md** - Consistency Issues

#### Fixes Applied:
✅ Special Derivatives section: Changed list items from `$$` to `$`
✅ Improved consistency with other documentation

---

### 4. **Calculus_2.md** - List Formatting

#### Fixes Applied:
✅ Basic integration rules: Changed from `$$` to `$` in bullet list
✅ Maintains consistency with calc_1.md style
